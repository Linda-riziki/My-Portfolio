# My-Portfolio
This portfolio project includes a comprehensive and informative README.md file that clearly explains the purpose of the site, the technologies used (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and step-by-step setup instructions for anyone who wants to clone, run, or contribute to the project. The README also outlines the structure of the codebase, provides guidance on customization, and highlights key features such as  CSS animations.I am still working on some features such as Responsiveness of this portfolio. 

Throughout the code, clear and concise comments are added to explain the function and purpose of various components, sections, and styling rules. This ensures that the code is easy to navigate, maintain, and expand uponâ€”whether by the original developer or others. The documentation and comments together make the portfolio developer-friendly and ready for versioning, deployment, or collaboration.
